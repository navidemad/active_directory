# Active Directory

Ruby Integration with Microsoft's Active Directory system based on original code by:
- Justin Mecham and James Hunt at http://rubyforge.org/projects/activedirectory
- ajrkerr at https://github.com/ajrkerr/active_directory

## Caching:

Queries for membership and group membership are based on the distinguished name of objects.
Doing a lot of queries, especially for a Rails app, is a sizable slowdown.
To alleviate the problem, I've implemented a very basic cache for queries which search by :distinguishedname.
This is disabled by default.
All other queries are unaffected.

A code example is worth a thousand words:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'active_directory'

# Uses the same settings as net/ldap
settings = {
	host: 'domain-controller.example.local',
	base: 'dc=example,dc=local',
	port: 636,
	encryption: :simple_tls,
	auth: {
	  method: :simple,
	  username: "username",
	  password: "password"
	}
}

# Basic usage
ActiveDirectory::Base.setup(settings)

ActiveDirectory::User.find(:all)
ActiveDirectory::User.find(:first, userprincipalname: "john.smith@domain.com")

ActiveDirectory::Group.find(:all)

# Caching is disabled by default, to enable:
ActiveDirectory::Base.enable_cache
ActiveDirectory::Base.disable_cache
ActiveDirectory::Base.cache?
```
